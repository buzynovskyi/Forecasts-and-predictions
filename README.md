# A project about forecasts and predictions in gym centre 

Project Description

The chain of fitness centers develops the strategy of interaction with clients on the basis of analytical data.

A common problem of fitness clubs and other services is customer churn. How do you know if a customer is no longer with you? You can write in the churn those who asked to close the contract or deleted the account. However, customers do not always leave defiantly: more often they stop using the service quietly.

Indicators of churn depend on the specifics of the industry. When a user seldom but steadily buys from the online store - it doesn't look like he "dropped out". But if he does not visit a channel with daily updated content for two weeks, things are bad: the subscriber got bored and seems to have left you.

For a fitness center, you can consider that the client has hit the churn if he hasn't visited the gym once in the last month. Of course, it is possible that he went to Bali and when he arrives will definitely continue to go to fitness. However, more often the opposite is true. If a client started his new life on Monday, went to the gym for a while, and then disappeared, he probably won't come back.

To combat churn, customer service department has converted many client questionnaires into electronic form. My job is to analyze and prepare an action plan to retain clients.

Specifically:

learn how to predict the likelihood of churn (at next month's level) for each client;

to form typical portraits of clients: to single out several most outstanding groups and to characterize their main features;

to analyze the main characteristics influencing most strongly on the churn;

formulate the main conclusions and develop recommendations for improving the quality of work with customers:

1) identify the target groups of customers;

2) to suggest measures to reduce churn;

3) determine other features of interaction with customers.
